## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SikshaLink seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Email us directly at [ratnaiiitg@gmail.com](mailto:ratnaiiitg@gmail.com)**
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce
4. **Wait for a response** - We aim to respond within 48 hours

## What to expect

Once you've submitted a vulnerability report, here's what will happen:

- We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We'll provide a detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your submission
- We'll keep you informed of our progress as we address the issue
- After the vulnerability has been fixed, we may ask you to validate the fix

## Bug Bounty

At this time, we don't offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we will acknowledge security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities in our CONTRIBUTORS.md file (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

- Never commit sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.)
